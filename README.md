# Caesar-Cipher-Ruby

This is the first project for the Ruby Course on The Odin Project.

From the Couree Material:
Implement a Caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string using a right shift:

  > caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)  
  => "Bmfy f xywnsl!"

# HOW TO USE

## caesar-cipher.rb
You'll be prompted with two inputs: the message you want to cipher and the cipher shift. The output is the ciphered message.

  > Message?  
  > ***What a string!***  
  > Shift?  
  > ***5***  
  > "Bmfy f xywnsl!"  

## caesasr-de-cipher.rb (personal extension)
You'll be prompted with two inputs: the ciphered message you had and the cipher shift (which you should know). The output is the original message.

  > What's the message?  
  > ***Bmfy f xywnsl!***  
  > How many?  
  > ***5***  
  > "What a string!"
